## Features

- **Sentiment Classification**: The project can predict the sentiment (positive/negative) of movie reviews.
- **Text Preprocessing Pipeline**:
  - Tokenization
  - Stop-word removal
  - Stemming or Lemmatization
- **Machine Learning Models**: Includes Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is the **IMDb movie review dataset**, containing:

- **Number of reviews**: 50,000 (25,000 for training, 25,000 for testing)
- **Classes**: Positive reviews, Negative reviews

You can download the dataset from [IMDb Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For developing the solution.
- **Libraries**:
  - `scikit-learn`: For model training and evaluation.
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation.
  - `nltk`: Natural language processing tasks.
  - `Flask/FastAPI` (Optional): For serving the model as an API.
  - `matplotlib`/`seaborn`: Data visualization.

## Model Training

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The raw movie reviews are preprocessed to clean the text, tokenize, remove stop-words, and apply lemmatization or stemming.
2. **Feature Extraction**: The processed text is converted into numerical features using techniques like:
   - Bag of Words (BoW)
   - Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
3. **Model Selection**: Models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM are trained and evaluated based on their performance metrics.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-score

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-ratings-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd movie-ratings-sentiment-analysis
   ```
